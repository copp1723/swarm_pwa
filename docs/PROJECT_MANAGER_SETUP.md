# Project Manager Agent Setup Guide

## Quick Implementation Steps

### 1. Add Project Manager Agent to Database

```sql
-- Connect to your SWARM database and run:
INSERT INTO agent_configs (name, system_prompt, description, model, max_tokens, temperature) VALUES (
  'Project Manager',
  'You are a Project Manager AI specialized in processing developer changelogs and translating technical updates into professional client communications. Your expertise includes:

CORE CAPABILITIES:
- Parse technical developer updates and extract project progress
- Map development tasks to customer-facing milestones  
- Calculate progress percentages and timeline impacts
- Generate professional client communications
- Learn project patterns and provide predictive insights
- Flag potential delays or risks proactively

COMMUNICATION STYLE:
- Professional and executive-level tone
- Clear, specific deliverables and timelines
- Business language (avoid technical jargon for client updates)
- Proactive and solution-oriented
- Confidence-building without over-promising

WORKFLOW PROCESSING:
When processing changelogs, always:
1. Extract project identifier (AI-YYYY-### format)
2. Categorize completed vs in-progress tasks
3. Identify any blockers or risks
4. Calculate progress impact (percentage)
5. Determine if phase transition occurred
6. Generate client-appropriate status update
7. Provide timeline and next steps

PATTERN RECOGNITION:
Learn from project history to:
- Predict common delay patterns
- Identify scope creep early
- Recommend proactive client communication
- Optimize resource allocation

Always maintain professional standards while being practical and results-focused.',

);
```

### 2. Register Project Manager Routes

Add to `server/routes.ts`:

```typescript
// Import the handler
import { projectManagerHandler } from './handlers/project-manager-handlers';

// Register in the routes function
function registerAllRoutes() {
  // ... existing routes
  registry.register('project_manager_chat', projectManagerHandler);
}
```

### 3. Create Project Manager Handler

```typescript
// server/handlers/project-manager-handlers.ts
import { z } from 'zod';
import { RouteHandler, RequestContext } from '../lib/route-registry';

export const projectManagerHandler: RouteHandler = {
  schema: z.object({
    message: z.string(),
    projectCode: z.string().optional(),
    autoProcess: z.boolean().default(false)
  }),
  
  handler: async (params, context: RequestContext) => {
    const { message, projectCode, autoProcess } = params;
    
    // Enhanced system prompt with project context
    let contextPrompt = `You are the Project Manager Agent. Process this request:

USER MESSAGE: ${message}`;

    // Add project context if provided
    if (projectCode) {
      contextPrompt += `\n\nPROJECT CODE: ${projectCode}`;
      
      // TODO: Add project data lookup when Project Tracker is connected
      // const project = await context.storage.getProjectByCode(projectCode);
      // if (project) {
      //   contextPrompt += `\nPROJECT DATA: ${JSON.stringify(project, null, 2)}`;
      // }
    }
    
    // Process with Project Manager agent
    const response = await context.agentService.processAgentRequest({
      userId: context.userId,
      conversationId: 1, // Default conversation for project management
      content: contextPrompt,
      agentType: 'Project Manager',
      model: 'anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet'
    });
    
    // Auto-process changelog if requested
    if (autoProcess && message.toLowerCase().includes('changelog')) {
      // TODO: Implement changelog processing pipeline
      // const processed = await processChangelog(message, projectCode);
      // return { ...response, processed };
    }
    
    return response;
  },
  
  description: 'Process requests with Project Manager Agent including changelog processing'
};
```

### 4. Test Project Manager Agent

Test the new agent via API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/rpc \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "project_manager_chat",
    "params": {
      "message": "Process this changelog: AutoMax project - completed API authentication, started dashboard testing",
      "projectCode": "AI-2024-087"
    },
    "id": 1
  }'
```

### 5. Add to Frontend Agent List

The Project Manager agent will automatically appear in the SWARM interface once added to the database, since agents are loaded dynamically.

## Changelog Processing Format

### Standard Developer Changelog Input

```
Project: AutoMax (AI-2024-087)
Developer: Rakesh Team
Date: 2025-01-15

Completed:
- Fixed API authentication bug
- Completed user permission module
- Database schema updates deployed

In Progress:
- Dashboard interface testing
- Mobile responsive adjustments

Blockers:
- Waiting for client API keys
- External service rate limiting

Notes:
- Dashboard testing should complete by Friday
- May need additional time for mobile optimization
```

### Expected Agent Output

```
CLIENT UPDATE for AutoMax Project (AI-2024-087):

Development Progress Update:
âœ“ User authentication system fully implemented and tested
âœ“ Access control framework completed with role-based permissions
âœ“ Database infrastructure updated to support new features

Current Focus:
â†’ Dashboard interface development and quality assurance testing
â†’ Mobile device compatibility optimization

Timeline Status:
Project remains on track for January 30th delivery. Dashboard testing phase initiated and progressing as scheduled.

Next Milestones:
- Dashboard interface completion (Jan 18)
- Mobile optimization finalization (Jan 22)
- Final testing and deployment preparation (Jan 25-30)

No current blockers affecting client timeline. Development team working on final phase optimizations to ensure smooth launch experience.
```

## Environment Variables Needed

Add to your environment:

```bash
# Project Tracker Integration (when ready)
PROJECT_TRACKER_URL=https://yourcompany.com/api
PROJECT_TRACKER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Enhanced OpenRouter usage for Project Manager
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_existing_key
```

## Ready for Integration

The Project Manager Agent is now ready to:

1. âœ… Process natural language changelog inputs
2. âœ… Generate professional client updates  
3. âœ… Maintain project context and memory
4. âœ… Work within existing SWARM chat interface
5. ðŸ”„ Connect to Project Tracker API (needs your database schema)
6. ðŸ”„ Implement automated pattern learning (needs historical data)

Once you provide the Project Tracker database schema and API endpoints, I can complete the full integration pipeline described in your executive summary.
