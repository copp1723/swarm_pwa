# Replit ↔ Local Development Sync Strategy

## Problem
Moving code from Replit to local deployment breaks the development cycle - changes become difficult to sync back to Replit.

## Solution: Hybrid Development Approach

### Phase 1: Continue Development in Replit
- Keep developing SWARM in Replit environment
- All agents, features, and improvements happen here
- Full testing and iteration in Replit

### Phase 2: Export for Local Deployment
When ready for local deployment with MCP filesystem access:

#### Option A: Download & Deploy Locally
```bash
# Download entire project as ZIP from Replit
# Extract to local machine
cd swarm-local
npm install
# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your local settings
npm run build
npm start
```

#### Option B: Git Sync (When Ready)
```bash
# In Replit shell (when you're ready)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial SWARM deployment"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/swarm.git
git push -u origin main

# On local machine
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/swarm.git
cd swarm
npm install
npm start
```

### Phase 3: Two-Way Sync Strategy
1. **Major features** → Develop in Replit
2. **Local testing** → Deploy to local for MCP filesystem access
3. **Sync changes** → Copy specific files back to Replit when needed

## Current Status: Development Phase
- Continue all SWARM development in Replit
- MCP filesystem integration ready for local deployment
- Local deployment files prepared but not activated
- Full feature development continues in Replit environment

## When to Deploy Locally
Only deploy locally when you specifically need:
- MCP filesystem access to desktop/CCL-3
- Custom domain configuration
- Enhanced privacy/security
- Faster performance

Until then, continue development in Replit without disruption.
