# SWARM Development Strategy

## Current Approach: Replit-First Development

### Why Stay in Replit
- Seamless development workflow without sync complexity
- All tools and environment already configured
- Easy testing and iteration
- No risk of losing changes between environments

### Local Deployment When Needed
The local deployment files are prepared and ready:
- `deploy.sh` - One-click local deployment
- `docker-compose.yml` - Container deployment
- `docs/LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete instructions
- Environment configuration ready

### Simple Export Process (When Ready)
1. **Download project as ZIP** from Replit
2. **Extract locally** and run `npm install`
3. **Configure environment** using `.env.example`
4. **Deploy with** `./deploy.sh`

### Benefits
- Continue iterating in familiar environment
- No GitHub complexity until you're ready
- Local deployment available when MCP filesystem access needed
- Best of both worlds: development flexibility + deployment readiness
