# SWARM Reliability Audit Results

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Incomplete Multi-Agent Collaboration Logic
**Issue**: `analyzeCollaborationNeeds()` was hardcoded to always return single agent
**Fix**: Implemented proper @mentions parsing and intelligent workflow determination
**Impact**: Multi-agent requests now work correctly

### 2. Broken Multi-Agent Result Synthesis  
**Issue**: `synthesizeMultiAgentResults()` only returned first result
**Fix**: Created comprehensive result combination with proper formatting
**Impact**: Multi-agent collaboration results are now properly combined

### 3. Unreliable MCP Handler Implementation
**Issue**: MCP handlers had incomplete error handling and validation
**Fix**: Added comprehensive validation, error handling, and direct filesystem integration
**Impact**: MCP filesystem operations now work reliably

### 4. Insecure File System Operations
**Issue**: Path sanitization was minimal, allowing potential security issues
**Fix**: Implemented comprehensive path validation, size limits, and security checks
**Impact**: File operations are now secure and reliable

### 5. Missing Input Validation
**Issue**: Message input lacked validation for length and agent types
**Fix**: Added validation for message length, agent existence, and error feedback
**Impact**: Prevents invalid requests and provides user feedback

### 6. OpenRouter Error Handling
**Issue**: Missing API key detection and validation
**Fix**: Added startup validation and clear error messages
**Impact**: Better error reporting when API keys are missing
