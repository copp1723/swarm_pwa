# Multi-Agent Chat System

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application that provides a multi-agent chat interface with memory capabilities. The system allows users to interact with different AI agents, store conversation history, and search through memory using semantic similarity. The application is built with a modern tech stack focusing on real-time chat interactions and intelligent agent orchestration.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/UI components with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom marble color palette
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **API Pattern**: JSON-RPC 2.0 for structured API communication
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle with PostgreSQL
- **Vector Database**: Supabase integration for semantic search (optional)
- **AI Integration**: OpenRouter for multiple LLM access

### Database Schema
The application uses PostgreSQL with the following main entities:
- **Users**: Authentication and user management
- **Conversations**: Chat session organization
- **Messages**: Individual chat messages with agent attribution
- **Memories**: Vector-embedded content for semantic search
- **Files**: File storage and metadata
- **Agent Configs**: Dynamic agent configuration and prompts

## Key Components

### Agent System
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Different agent types (communication, coder, analyst, researcher, writer)
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Agents configured via database with customizable system prompts
- **Context Management**: Intelligent context building with conversation history and memory retrieval
- **Token Management**: Tracks and reports token usage across interactions

### Memory System
- **Semantic Search**: Vector embeddings for content similarity matching
- **Dual Storage**: Local PostgreSQL storage with optional Supabase vector enhancement
- **Context Retrieval**: Automatic memory injection into agent conversations
- **Metadata Tracking**: Rich metadata for enhanced search and organization

### Communication Layer
- **JSON-RPC API**: Structured method calls for all client-server communication
- **Real-time Updates**: Query invalidation for live UI updates
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management with user feedback
- **Service Status**: Real-time monitoring of external service availability

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: Chat messages entered through React components
2. **API Processing**: JSON-RPC calls route to appropriate service handlers
3. **Agent Processing**: Selected agent processes message with context from memory
4. **LLM Integration**: OpenRouter forwards requests to appropriate language models
5. **Memory Storage**: Conversations automatically stored with vector embeddings
6. **Response Delivery**: Agent responses delivered back through query system
7. **UI Updates**: Real-time UI updates via TanStack Query cache invalidation

## External Dependencies

### Required Services
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database (configured via DATABASE_URL)
- **OpenRouter**: LLM access (OPENROUTER_API_KEY required)

### Optional Services
- **Supabase**: Enhanced vector search (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL option (@neondatabase/serverless)

### Development Tools
- **Replit Integration**: Development environment optimization
- **Vite Plugins**: Runtime error handling and development tooling
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across frontend and backend

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Hot Reload**: Vite dev server with middleware integration
- **Database Migrations**: Drizzle push for schema updates
- **Environment**: NODE_ENV=development with debug logging

### Production
- **Build Process**: Vite frontend build + esbuild server bundling
- **Static Serving**: Express serves built frontend assets
- **Process Management**: Single Node.js process with Express middleware
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling via Drizzle

### Replit Configuration
- **Modules**: nodejs-20, web, postgresql-16
- **Deployment**: Autoscale deployment target
- **Port Mapping**: Internal 5000 â†’ External 80
- **Workflows**: Parallel development workflow
